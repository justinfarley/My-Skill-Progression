# Menu System

## This is my go at a menu system. I am including this in my skill progression because i learned a lot and got a lot better at functional programming while I have been making this system.
## Specifically the `UI Animations` Folder contains extensions and other data structures I created for holding the information for these animations, and calling these functions
## In a nice pure, clean, easy to read, functional way. When I first saw something like this my interest was peaked, so to say that I made this myself is accomplishing for me.
## Even if you can't understand code, you can understand this. (probably):
