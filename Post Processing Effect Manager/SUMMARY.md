# This was a little creation so that I could more easily mess with the post processing how i wanted through code and it turned out alright i made a cool pulsing effect so im sure theres a lot more i could do

# One thing I definitely want to do is to add an enum for animation curve options like linear cubic ... i think that could be cool and could be passed in as a parameter thatd be cool. Also need some wrapper API but this one has a ways to go i guess.
